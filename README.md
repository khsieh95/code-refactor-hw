# code-refactor-hw
This repository is in reference to the first homework assignment, where we were asked to optimize  a site 
in terms of the accessibility standards. Changes were made to both the index.html and style.css files in 
order to clean up and organize their functions. 

<!-- Removed div tags and replaced with semantics -->

Prior to the changes I made (didn't get a screenshot), index.html was strictly made of <div> tags. In order 
to clean up the structure, all <div> tags were removed and replaced with semantic tags such as <header> , <figure>,
<footer> and many more. Refer to screenshot link. 



<!-- Combined tags that had the same changes -->
